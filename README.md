### A Customizable, Zero-Framework AI Chat Experience
****

**Gemna Chat** is a versatile and highly customizable AI chat web application designed for privacy, flexibility, and a beautiful user experience. Built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and Tailwind CSS (via CDN), this project demonstrates that powerful, modern web apps don't always require heavy frameworks or complex build steps.

It's designed to be your personal chat interface, allowing you to create unique AI characters, style the conversation to your liking, and connect to multiple powerful large language models.

## üöÄ Getting Started

You can run Gemna Chat locally with just a few steps. Setting up Firebase is optional but recommended for cloud sync.

### 1. Set Up a Firebase Project (Optional)

If you want to enable cloud sync and user accounts:

1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2.  In your project, go to the **Authentication** section, click "Get Started," and enable the **Google** and **Anonymous** sign-in providers.
3.  Go to the **Firestore Database** section, click "Create database," and start in **Production mode**. Choose a location close to you.
4.  Navigate to the **Rules** tab in Firestore and replace the default rules with the following:
    ```
    rules_version = '2';
    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
        // Users can only read/write their own data in their own subdirectory
        match /users/{userId}/{document=**} {
          allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
        }
      }
    }
    ```
5.  Go to your Project Settings (click the ‚öôÔ∏è icon) and in the "General" tab, scroll down to "Your apps."
6.  Click the Web icon (`</>`) to add a new web app. Give it a nickname and click "Register app."
7.  Firebase will provide you with a `firebaseConfig` object. **Copy this entire object.**

### 2. Set Up the Application Locally

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/gemna-chat.git
    cd gemna-chat
    ```
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your code editor.
3.  Find the `<script type="module">` tag at the bottom of the file.
4.  Locate the `firebaseConfig` constant and **replace the placeholder object with the one you copied from your Firebase project.**
    ```javascript
    // Your provided Firebase configuration
    const firebaseConfig = { // PASTE YOUR CONFIG OBJECT HERE
        apiKey: "...",
        authDomain: "...",
        projectId: "...",
        // ...and so on
    };
    ```
5.  **That's it!** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start using the app.

### 3. Configure API Keys

To chat with an AI, you need to provide an API key:

1.  Open the app and click the Settings icon (‚öôÔ∏è) in the top-right corner.
2.  Navigate to the "API & Model" section.
3.  Select your desired API Provider (Gemini, Groq, or OpenRouter).
4.  Enter your API key. You can get them here:
    *   [**Google AI Studio**](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) for Gemini
    *   [**GroqCloud Console**](https://console.groq.com/keys) for Groq
    *   [**OpenRouter Keys**](https://openrouter.ai/keys) for OpenRouter
